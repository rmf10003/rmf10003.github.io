    <h1>WELCOME TO MY WEBSITE</h1>
    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p>
            I’m a Software Engineer who is keenly interested in data science and machine learning.<br>
            I love Python, its massive community and all of the modules and libraries that comprise that ecosystem.<br>
            I have recently been learning about NumPy, Pandas and other data science tools built for Python programming.<br>
            I am currently working on a program that uses natural language processing to analyze online computer science journals<br>
            for statistics on popular machine learning projects and techniques.<br><br>

            Three things that make me a unique individual are that I am a people person, I am an athlete and I am a scientist.<br>
            After college, I worked in door to door sales for an entire year where I learned how to better understand<br>
            how to answer people’s needs.  I am an advocate powerlifter and am currently a member of the District Barbell Club.<br>
            I graduated from The University of Connecticut with a B.S. degree in biophysics.<br>
            I find it is very helpful to be scientifically literate.  Due to my extreme competitiveness,<br>
            scientific literacy and strong communications skills, I feel that I am uniquely capable of leading a team<br>
            in a positive and informed manner to quickly creating useful software.<br>
